# ⏳ ChronoX (Timers)

**ChronoX** is a sleek, fluid, and deeply customizable time tracking app built with **React Native + Expo**.  
It helps you keep track of how much time is **left _until_ or has _passed since_** any target date — elegantly broken down into **years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most countdown or count-up apps are either too cluttered, too plain, or lack the depth of customization modern users crave.  
ChronoX solves this by offering:

- A **soft, immersive UI** that feels easy on the eyes yet vibrant.
- Rich personalization across themes, layouts, accent colors, header navigation, and even borders.
- A dynamic, smooth experience using **carefully chosen transitions and animations**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Fully customizable appearance:**  
  - Choose between light, dark, or neutral themes.
  - Adjust border styles, accent colors, header & navigation settings.
  - Toggle between grid or list layouts.

- 💫 **Animated UI:**  
  - Subtle transitions and interactions create a smooth, delightful experience.

- 📤 **Export Options:**  
  - Save timer cards as **PNG images** for sharing or journaling.
  - Export all timers in **JSON format** for backups or future imports.

- 🔔 **Future-ready:**  
  - Planned features include smart reminders, widgets, and even richer analytics. ( depends on the mood though)

- ✅ **Feedback-friendly:**  
  - The app integrates meaningful toast & alert feedback to keep you informed.
